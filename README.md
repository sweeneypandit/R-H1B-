Visual analysis of H1B file on R Studio
Hi Guys,
So this R file has many visualiztaions that I have tried out in R studio.I have basically analyzed the H1B data file on kaggle link -https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have tried some single and multi dimension plots to analyse the data. Gathered some insights on which cities provide most H1B, which 
job title is most favourable for H1B, how the visa case status has changed over the years. Some Exploratory analysis on the data and vivid
visualizations to go along with it. Have fun exploring it :)
